Description: Implementation of local inferential procedures for functional data in different frameworks (i.e., one or two-population frameworks, functional linear models).    The current version of the package requires functional data evaluated on a uniform grid or fda objects, and provides the adjusted and unadjusted p-value functions based on nonparametric local tests. The package provides a plotting function creating a graphical output of the procedure: the p-value heat-map, the plot of the p-value functions, and the plot of the functional data.
