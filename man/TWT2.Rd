\title{Two population Threshold Wise Testing procedure}
\usage{
TWT2(
  data1,
  data2,
  mu = 0,
  B = 1000,
  paired = FALSE,
  dx = NULL,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{First population's data. Either pointwise evaluations of the functional data set on a uniform grid, or a \code{fd} object from the package \code{fda}.
If pointwise evaluations are provided, \code{data2} is a matrix of dimensions \code{c(n1,J)}, with \code{J} evaluations on columns and \code{n1} units on rows.}

\item{data2}{Second population's data. Either pointwise evaluations of the functional data set on a uniform grid, or a \code{fd} object from the package \code{fda}.
If pointwise evaluations are provided, \code{data2} is a matrix of dimensions \code{c(n1,J)}, with \code{J} evaluations on columns and \code{n2} units on rows.}

\item{mu}{Functional mean difference under the null hypothesis. Three possibilities are available for \code{mu}:
a constant (in this case, a constant function is used);
a \code{J}-dimensional vector containing the evaluations on the same grid which \code{data} are evaluated;
a \code{fd} object from the package \code{fda} containing one function.
The default is \code{mu=0}.}

\item{B}{The number of iterations of the MC algorithm to evaluate the p-values of the permutation tests. The defualt is \code{B=1000}.}

\item{paired}{Flag indicating whether a paired test has to be performed. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{dx}{Used only if a \code{fd} object is provided. In this case, \code{dx} is the size of the discretization step of the grid  used to evaluate functional data.
If set to \code{NULL}, a grid of size 100 is used. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "\code{two.sided}" (default), "\code{greater}" or "\code{less}".}
}
\value{
\code{TWT2} returns an object of \code{\link{class}} "\code{fdatest2}" containing the following components:
\item{test}{String vector indicating the type of test performed. In this case equal to \code{"2pop"}.}
\item{mu}{Evaluation on a grid of the functional mean difference under the null hypothesis (as entered by the user).}
\item{unadjusted_pval}{Evaluation on a grid of the unadjusted p-value function.}
\item{adjusted_pval}{Evaluation on a grid of the adjusted p-value function.}
\item{data.eval}{Evaluation on a grid of the functional data.}
\item{ord_labels}{Vector of labels indicating the group membership of data.eval}
}
\description{
The function implements the Threshold Wise Testing procedure for testing mean differences between two
functional populations. Functional data are tested locally and unadjusted and adjusted p-value
functions are provided. The unadjusted p-value function controls the point-wise error rate. The adjusted p-value function controls the
family-wise error rate asymptotically.

# Importing the NASA temperatures data set
data(NASAtemp)

# Performing the TWT for two populations
TWT.result <- TWT2(NASAtemp$paris,NASAtemp$milan)

# Plotting the results of the TWT
plot(TWT.result,xrange=c(0,12),main='TWT results for testing mean differences')


# Selecting the significant components at 5\% level
which(TWT.result$adjusted_pval < 0.05)
