\usage{
ITP2fourier(data1, data2, mu = 0, maxfrequency = floor(dim(data1)[2]/2),
  B = 10000, paired = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{Pointwise evaluations of the first population's functional data set on a uniform grid. \code{data1} is a matrix of dimensions \code{c(n1,J)}, with \code{J} evaluations on columns and \code{n1} units on rows.}

\item{data2}{Pointwise evaluations of the second population's functional data set on a uniform grid. \code{data2} is a matrix of dimensions \code{c(n2,J)}, with \code{J} evaluations on columns and \code{n2} units on rows.}

\item{mu}{The difference between the first functional population and the second functional population under the null hypothesis. Either a constant (in this case, a constant function is used) or a \code{J}-dimensional vector containing the evaluations on the same grid which \code{data} are evaluated. The default is \code{mu=0}.}

\item{maxfrequency}{The maximum frequency to be used in the Fourier basis expansion of data. The default is \code{floor(dim(data1)[2]/2)}, leading to an interpolating expansion.}

\item{B}{The number of iterations of the MC algorithm to evaluate the p-values of the permutation tests. The defualt is \code{B=1000}.}

\item{paired}{A logical indicating whether the test is paired. The default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{ITP2fourier} returns an object of \code{\link{class}} "\code{ITP2}".
An object of class "\code{ITP2}" is a list containing at least the following components:
\item{basis}{String vector indicating the basis used for the first phase of the algorithm. In this case equal to \code{"Fourier"}.}
\item{test}{String vector indicating the type of test performed. In this case equal to \code{"2pop"}.}
\item{mu}{Difference between the first functional population and the second functional population under the null hypothesis
(as entered by the user).}
\item{paired}{Logical indicating whether the test is paired (as entered by the user).}
\item{coeff}{Matrix of dimensions \code{c(n,p)} of the \code{p} coefficients of the B-spline basis expansion,
with \code{n=n1+n2}. Rows are associated to units and columns to the basis index.
The first \code{n1} rows report the coefficients of the first population units and the following \code{n2} rows report the coefficients
of the second population units}
\item{pval}{Unadjusted p-values for each basis coefficient.}
\item{pval.matrix}{Matrix of dimensions \code{c(p,p)} of the p-values of the multivariate tests. The element \code{(i,j)} of matrix \code{pval.matrix} contains the p-value of the joint NPC test of the components \code{(j,j+1,...,j+(p-i))}.}
\item{adjusted.pval}{Adjusted p-values for each basis coefficient.}
\item{labels}{Labels indicating the population membership of each data.}
\item{data.eval}{Evaluation on a fine uniform grid of the functional data obtained through the basis expansion.}
\item{heatmap.matrix}{Heatmap matrix of p-values (used only for plots).}
}
\description{
The function implements the Interval Testing Procedure for testing the difference between two functional populations evaluated on a uniform grid. Data are represented by means of the Fourier basis and the significance of each basis coefficient is tested with an interval-wise control of the Family Wise Error Rate.

# Importing the NASA temperatures data set
data(NASAtemp)

# Performing the ITP
ITP.result <- ITP2fourier(NASAtemp$milan,NASAtemp$paris,maxfrequency=20,B=1000,paired=TRUE)

# Plotting the results of the ITP
